# lds-intranet

Librería de Satoshi's intranet — source of truth for instructor onboarding and
course submission, with handoff to Moodle.

> **Status:** Planning / pre-implementation. No application code yet — this repo holds the
> product specification (PRD), the architecture decision, and the per-story breakdown.

## Context

The intranet is a standalone app (independent of Moodle) that owns the course
submission lifecycle: from a user deciding to teach, through a wizard and drafts,
to a GitHub-based approval workflow run by Operations, and finally the handoff to
Moodle. After handoff, content lives in Moodle and the intranet keeps the record
as history (basis for future analytics).

- The intranet is the **source of truth** for intake and approval.
- Moodle = post-handoff execution / final destination of the content.
- Identity is federated through a dedicated IdP (OIDC); see Story 00.
- The public front (instructor profiles, course landing pages) is **deferred to phase 2**
  (story 08); v1 ships the private workflow only.

## Sources of truth (read these first)

1. **PRD** — `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/prds/prd-lds-intranet-2026-06-16/prd.md`
   (the what: FRs, scope, glossary, status lifecycle).
2. **Architecture** — `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md`
   (the how: stack, structure, patterns).
3. **`CLAUDE.md`** (repo root) — working instructions for any AI/dev; routes to the above.
4. **`docs/stories/` + `docs/stories/tasks/`** — scope checklist (thin pointers to 1–2).

## Stories (epic ENG-271)

Story files live in `docs/stories/` (numbered 00–09; `06b` and `09` are extras). The
master Jira sequence (ENG-27x) is an older, coarser mapping — several files share one
Jira id. Mapping:
